# Step 8: Testing and Verification

## Overview
This step involved verifying the functionality of the implemented features, specifically the Morgan logging middleware.

## Actions Taken

1.  **Morgan Middleware Testing**:
    *   The user requested to verify if Morgan was working correctly without changing code.
    *   Executed `curl` commands to hit the root endpoint (`GET /`).
    *   Verified that the server was running and responding.
    *   Confirmed that in `development` mode, Morgan logs requests to the console (visible in the terminal running the server).

2.  **API Documentation Management**:
    *   Created a comprehensive `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` file detailing the available endpoints.
    *   Note: The `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` file was moved/managed by the user (currently resides in the `documentation` folder).
